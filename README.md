# C Programming and CMake Learning Plan

## Overview
This plan is structured to take you from a beginner to an advanced C programmer, including the use of CMake, which is not a package manager but a build system generator that helps manage the build process in C/C++ projects.

### **Duration:** 6-12 months  
### **Commitment:** 10-15 hours per week

## Phase 1: Basics of C (Weeks 1-4)
### **Goal:** Understand the syntax, control structures, and basic programming constructs in C.

#### **Milestones:**
- [ ] **Week 1: Introduction to C**
  - [ ] Install a C compiler (GCC) and set up your development environment.
  - [ ] Learn about basic syntax, variables, data types, and operators.
  - [ ] Write simple programs to perform arithmetic operations.

- [ ] **Week 2: Control Structures**
  - [ ] Master `if`, `else`, `switch`, and loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
  - [ ] Implement small programs using these control structures.

- [ ] **Week 3: Functions and Arrays**
  - [ ] Understand how to define and call functions, pass arguments, and return values.

  - [ ] Write programs that use pointers and dynamic memory.

#### **Final Goal for Phase 1:**
- [ ] Be comfortable writing basic programs, using functions, arrays, and pointers.

## Phase 2: Intermediate Concepts (Weeks 5-10)

  - [ ] Write programs to read and write files.

- [ ] **Week 7: Dynamic Memory and Linked Lists**
  - [ ] Implement linked lists using dynamic memory.
  - [ ] Understand memory management in more complex data structures.

- [ ] **Week 8: Function Pointers and Callbacks**
  - [ ] Learn about function pointers and their use cases.
  - [ ] Write programs that use function pointers for callbacks.

- [ ] **Week 9: Recursion and Algorithm Implementation**
  - [ ] Understand and implement recursive algorithms.
  - [ ] Solve problems using recursion.

- [ ] **Week 10: Error Handling and Debugging**
  - [ ] Learn about error handling techniques in C.
  - [ ] Familiarize yourself with debugging tools like `gdb`.

#### **Final Goal for Phase 2:**
- [ ] Write more complex programs, including data structures like linked lists, and handle file I/O efficiently.

## Phase 3: Advanced Concepts in C (Weeks 11-20)
### **Goal:** Master advanced C concepts and system-level programming.

#### **Milestones:**
- [ ] **Week 11-12: Concurrency and Multi-threading**
  - [ ] Learn the basics of multi-threading in C using `pthread`.
  - [ ] Implement multi-threaded programs.

- [ ] **Week 13-14: Interfacing with Assembly**
  - [ ] Learn how to write inline assembly in C.
  - [ ] Understand how C interfaces with low-level code.

- [ ] **Week 15-16: System Programming**
  - [ ] Dive into system-level programming, including process control, IPC, and socket programming.
  - [ ] Write programs that interact with the operating system.

- [ ] **Week 17-18: Optimization Techniques**
  - [ ] Learn how to optimize C code for performance.
  - [ ] Understand compiler optimizations and how to leverage them.

- [ ] **Week 19-20: Real-time and Embedded Systems Programming**
  - [ ] Introduction to real-time programming in C.
  - [ ] Write code for embedded systems.

#### **Final Goal for Phase 3:**
- [ ] Be able to write high-performance, multi-threaded, and system-level applications in C.

## Phase 4: CMake and Build Systems (Weeks 21-24)
### **Goal:** Learn how to use CMake to manage and build C projects.

#### **Milestones:**
- [ ] **Week 21: Introduction to CMake**
  - [ ] Understand the basics of CMake and how it works.
  - [ ] Set up a simple project using CMake.

- [ ] **Week 22: Building Projects with CMake**
  - [ ] Learn how to define targets, link libraries, and manage dependencies.
  - [ ] Build a multi-file C project using CMake.

- [ ] **Week 23: Advanced CMake Features**
  - [ ] Explore advanced features like custom commands, macros, and toolchain files.
  - [ ] Optimize build processes with CMake.

- [ ] **Week 24: Integrating CMake with Other Tools**
  - [ ] Learn how to integrate CMake with other tools like `make`, `ninja`, or IDEs.
  - [ ] Automate testing and deployment with CMake.

#### **Final Goal for Phase 4:**
- [ ] Efficiently manage and build complex C projects using CMake.

## Final Phase: Project-Based Learning (Weeks 25-30)
### **Goal:** Consolidate your knowledge by working on real-world projects.

#### **Milestones:**
